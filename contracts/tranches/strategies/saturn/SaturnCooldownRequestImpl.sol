/**
 * @title SaturnCooldownRequestImpl
 * @dev Implementation of the unstake process for sUSDat tokens via Saturn's WithdrawalQueueERC721.
 * This contract is designed to be used within the UnstakeCooldown contract.
 *
 * Flow:
 * 1. `request()` - calls `sUSDat.requestRedeem(shares, 0)` which:
 *    - Internally transfers sUSDat shares from this contract to the WithdrawalQueue
 *    - Mints an ERC721 NFT representing the withdrawal request to this contract
 *    - No approval needed: requestRedeem uses internal _transfer
 * 2. Saturn's off-chain processor processes the withdrawal request:
 *    - Converts STRC to USDat as needed
 *    - Marks the request as Processed in the WithdrawalQueue
 * 3. `finalize()` - calls `sUSDat.claim()` which:
 *    - Calls WithdrawalQueue.claimAllFor(this) — transfers USDat to this contract
 *    - Reverts with NothingToClaim if not yet processed (caught by UnstakeCooldown's try/catch)
 *    - This contract then transfers USDat to the receiver
 *
 * Note: Saturn's withdrawal queue has no fixed SLA. Processing typically takes ~7 days.
